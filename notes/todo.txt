major strokes:
- input and output (append stuff to #screen element), use keypad input in index.js
- general operating system
- computer filesystem

polish:
- add an actual room (maybe just primitive squares for now? we can texture them using the Textures folder)
- a desk?
- how the hell are we going to do notes lying around / post its or w/e

small things:
- click computer to lock view to screen (currently clicking it teleports you in front of it)
- hit escape to leave screen view
- make a beep when you press a symbol (use bry's beeps)
